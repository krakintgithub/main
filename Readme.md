# Krakin't Code of Conduct and Ethics - Version 0.02

The following are some rules that were composed by Krakin't. They are to serve as a business as well as a moral conduct. All of these rules were made by observing other tokens and the ways they operated.

p0:

s0: Paragraphs can be changed only if it means adding the logical and a functional value, elaborating or correcting the language in use.
s1: The written paragraphs or sub-paragraphs may be re-written into sub-paragraphs and re-organized.
s2: Paragraph changes must not alter the existing meaning or interpretations in any-way. 
s3: Krakin't may add new paragraphs and subparagraphs, if and only if, it does not alter or contradict the existing paragraphs.
s4: There must be no loop-holes introduced while changing the paragraphs.
s5: Any contradiction that may exist or that is introduced has to be explained while providing the circumstances when such contradictions may be applicable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

p1:

s0: At any moment, under any circumstances, there must be NO GATE-KEEPING.
s1: Anyone, at any stage of development, must be accepted to incubate their projects and ideas.
s2: Nobody is to be forced to share or expose their intellectual property, identity, personal information, ideas, … against their will.
s3: However, in extreme cases such as targeting the individuals or groups of individuals and imposing disadvantages, Krakin't may apply the gate-keeping measures.
s4: Depending on the extreme of the cases (mentioned in p1.s3), Krakin't may apply extreme measures such as banning and token burning.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

p2:

s0: [Premise] Individual ideas are sometimes better than the ideas of the community, and vice versa.
s1: Given the premise p2.s0, at any moment, under any circumstances, Krakin't must not rely on the voting mechanisms.
s2: If an individual (or the community) wants a change to be implemented, then they (individuals or community) should provide evidence and an explanation regarding the mutual benefit (between them and Krakin't).
s3: Given the p2.s0-s2, Krakin't is independent of the community and can apply the necessary change to Krakin't features.
s4: Any change to any Krakin't features must be transparent and open to everyone.
s5: Community may petition for a change to be done, reverted, or not done at all, while Krakin't must obey the petitions provided the valid arguments proposed by the petition.
s6: [Definition] For p2.s5, definition of a valid argument is any argument that clearly demonstrates the mutual benefits (or disadvantages) between Krakin't business model as well as the community.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

p3:

s0: Krakin't must not rely on the community or culture in order to function, and must be independent of the community.
s1: [Premise] The concept of the culture is in a direct contradiction with the concept of decentralization. 
s2: We all come from different backgrounds. Everyone is to be treated as an individual believing in their individual rights, and without any disrespect to their beliefs.
s3: The official rules will have to be respected on the official channels (not to be confused with p1.s0).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

p4:

s0: Intellectual properties are to be respected above all and everything else (otherwise, p1.s3 may be applied).
s1: Although p1.s3 may be applied, Krakin't will never take anyone's tokens or wealth into possession, under any circumstances.
s2: An add-on or a change coded by the third party or a non-Krakin't affiliated individual will be used if and only if the source-code is shared with everyone (respecting p4.s0).
s3: Krakin't will implement the add-ons and code-changes depending on the internal resources and the road-maps.
s4: Concept of marketing should not be confused with the concepts of having a community and a culture. 
s5: Krakin't should always give the higher priority to cooperation between the individuals rather than the marketing aimed toward the masses.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
p5:

s0: It is not possible to make every single Krakin't feature decentralized, however, Krakin't should always aim toward decentralization. 
s1: If decentralized technology evolves for some centralized Krakin't feature (or a component) to become decentralized, then Krakin't will have to make a transfer from centralized to decentralized (for that feature or a component).
s2: p5.s1 excludes incompatible technologies and programming languages, as well as the expensive and the resource-hungry solutions. 
s3: No technology transfer is to be made if it introduces undesired risks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

p6:

s0: Krakin't will remain a mutable token, meaning, all components (except the native Token component) can be managed. 
s1: The only purpose for introducing a mutable token is to be able to evolve. 
s2: [Premise] mutable tokens can be suspected of corruption given the amount of a centralized control.
s3: p6.s2 means that Krakin't relies on trust, is not trustless, and that mutability is to be used only for the purpose of evolving the token.
s4: Minting new tokens, other than by mining, is to be done under the circumstances that involve an incident or when it is required for Krakin't to provide liquidity. 
s5: If some authority locks Krakin't tokens due to an internal bug or absurd rules, then Krakin't will simply burn those tokens and mint the new ones directly into individual's account. 
s6: Krakin't may mint tokens to provide liquidity, if and only if, it does not involve altering the existing functions of a token such as mining. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

p7:

s0: A business or idea that is incubated under Krakin't does not require to have a token or a crypto-currency of any kind.
s1: A business or idea owner does not need to know anything regarding the block-chain(s) in order to operate under Krakin't.
s2: No private keys, unless encrypted and inaccessible (due to encryption), is to be stored by Krakin't.
s3: Per request, users can and will always obtain their private keys, assuming that their accounts are within the domain of the Krakin't database(s).
