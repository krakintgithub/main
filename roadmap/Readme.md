# Krakin't Dynamic Roadmap

OPEN:
- Make the solominer adaptable to ETH 2.0 blocks per second (so we can do the manual-tune)
- Test/Redeploy router and core before the presale or any other big event (security updated)
- Research the existing project incubators, organize research data to fit Krakin't
- Look for project incubators that would help Krakint take-off
- Whitepaper writeups (after the research, solo miner, and treasury)
- Mention the token once everything is properly done, here: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_burn
- Code and deploy the webpage.
- Register Krakin't as the sole proprietorship in Canada, Ontario
- Register the logo and a trademark
- Investigate Metamask code to become the the Krakin't DAPP
- Deploy the miner
- Code the treasury
- Deploy the treasury
- If possible, make the miner work with adjusted Metamask
- Contact remote Canadian businesses and ask about APP ideas that would help their business
- See what the current project incubators are doing right and wrong
- Setup the chat or the communication channels for the community
- Investigate what is necessary for the CoinMarketcap listing, and update the roadmap
- List the token on CoinMarketcap once everything is done
- Investigate exchanges and list the token on swaps, relays, exchanges etc.
- List the token on coinbase and etherscan
- Look into U.K. grants and make proposals
- Look into registering Krakin't in the U.K.
- Look into registering Krakin't in Serbia (probably very hard to do)
- Look into registering Krakin't in any other country.
- Register the miner with the Canadian patent office (or US office if Canadian one is unreasonable) - when the group miner is done
